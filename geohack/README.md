# geohack
2018 geohackathon
This project was completed during the 2018 subsurface-geohackathon in Salt Lake City. The
project initially focused on picking formation tops in a sequence stratigraphic framework. 
It ended up with us looking into automatic formation top picking without any training data, and
has the potential to build into a full blown automatic top correlation machine. Fork away!
