# CHANGES.md

## 0.4.0, 20 November 2018
- There are breaking changes in this release.
- Export the curves in the current `well.data` to Pandas DataFrame with `well.df()`. Previously, this function returned the DataFrame of the associated LAS file, which is still available in `well.las.df()`. 
- Export the curves in the current Project as a Pandas DataFrame with a dual index: UWI and depth.
- Made the APIs of various functions more consistent, e.g. with `keys` always being before `basis`. This regularization will continue.
- Made the way to retrieve `keys` more consistent, using the flattened list of keys, if provided, or getting all those keys corresponding to curves, if not. Some of the well methods used to break if there were striplogs in `well.data`, but they should behave a bit better now.
- Thanks to Jesper Dramsch, the documentation should now be working again. Thanks Jesper!
- Added this `CHANGES.md` file.
- Synthetics don't work anyway and are definitely broken right now. Test is withheld for now.
