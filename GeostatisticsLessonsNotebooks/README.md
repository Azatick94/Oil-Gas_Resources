# Geostatistics Lessons Notebooks

[Geostatistics Lessons](http://geostatisticslessons.com/) is an open disclosure of some guidance in geostatistical modeling reviewed by an editorial board. These python notebooks and data are prepared by Lesson authors to supplement their Lesson. As new Lessons are authored and notebooks created, this repository will be updated. 

## Lessons

Lessons with notebooks and data available include:

* An Application of Bayes Theorem to Geostatistical Mapping ([notebook](notebooks/bayesmapping/bayesmapping.ipynb) and [lesson](http://geostatisticslessons.com/lessons/bayesmapping)), Jared Deutsch and Clayton Deutsch, 2018

## Dependencies

Notebooks are implemented in Python 3 using the scientific python stack (including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib). Refer to the individual notebooks for any particular dependencies. 

## License

Notebooks are licensed under the [MIT](LICENSE) license separately from Lessons. Refer to [Geostatistics Lessons](http://geostatisticslessons.com/) for licensing information on the Lessons.
